        <h1>Be Always Curious...</h1>

        <h3>When I started fitness, that was my passion — but it changed as time went on.</h3>
        <h3>I first discovered martial arts through my brother, since he used to train Taekwondo.</h3>
        <h3>What I love about martial arts is the art itself — you can learn new skills, create your own, and it’s such a versatile sport.</h3>
        <h3>Then I moved on to boxing. I learned it on my own, but I felt like it wasn’t fully my thing.</h3>
        <h3>So I tried wrestling — and that’s where it clicked. I really liked it, and my background in weightlifting helped a lot.</h3>
        <h3>I also love MMA, because mixing kicks, punches, and takedowns just feels natural.</h3>
        <h3>Along the journey, I started recording myself and editing my videos on CapCut.</h3>
        <h3>Later, I saw my brother coding, and that got me curious. I started learning HTML and now I’m learning CSS.</h3>
        <h3>I also got interested in biological health after watching a video about it — it seemed fascinating and I want to learn more, because it can really help my future.</h3>
